# Bianchi-et-al-2024-MSK-risk-following-SRC
This repository holds the data and code accompanying the manuscript by Bianchi et al, titled "Concussion increases the risk of future musculoskeletal injury among male and female university athletes."
The file "df.csv" can be used with the "script.r" file, alongside the "logit_mod.stan" and "logit_mod_prior.stan" STAN files to run the models used to generate the results reported in the paper, as well as create Table 1 and Figure 1. Two more figures not found in the manuscript but potentially relevant to the reader can also be found in "script.r": a figure created from the prior model simulation to show the range of possibile values for the probability of future injury risk in each group, and a posterior predictive check of the probability of future injury risk by group after the model was run on the sample data.
